### Data Points Importer

Purpose: Process Survey Data* and insert Blocks or MTEXT into a Georeferenced 
AutoCAD drawing. Includes ability to create and assign Object Data to imported
Entities (Blocks or MTEXT).

* Note: AutoCAD Map can import CSV's but we frequently receive Excel spreadsheets 
with LL83/WGS84 survey points. This program was developed to not only meet that need 
but to also provide these features:

- process multiple different Blocks in one step
- process multiple different Layers in one step
- create and assign Object Data during import

Targets:
     .NET Framework 4.7
     AutoCAD Map 3D 2019 API

Required files:
     Data Points Importer.xlsm (creates CSV. See "How To" tab for instructions)
