about=This plug-in is for automating the process of filling Terminal information on the "TERMINAL SHEET" of an Excel Workbook. It does this by checking and validating the layer created by a Spatial Join into an Attribute Join of Terminal, Poles, and Addresses. Once the 'Final' Join Layer has been validated, it translates the fields (attribute table) into a format (formated CSV file) that the Excel VBA subroutine 'ProcessCSVFile' works with to automatically fill up to 99 Terminals with the required information.
